Wahyudi, A. J., Hernawan, U. E., Alifatri, L. O., Prayudha, B., Sani, S. Y., Febriani, F., & Ulumuddin, Y. I. (2022). Carbon-offset potential from tropical seagrass conservation in selected areas of Indonesia. Marine Pollution Bulletin, 178, 113605. https://doi.org/10.1016/J.MARPOLBUL.2022.113605

You can use SCE-P_v2.1.ipynb and run it directly on platforms like Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
Interactively, you need to enter the data:
- total seagrass extent in the province (ha) #compulsory
- seagrass extent in the MPA (ha) #compulsory
- Emission Factor for Baseline (BAU) (%) #compulsory

Minimum you should have one of the following ecological data:
- biomass (g/m²) #enter zero (0) if you do not have the data
- density (shoots/m²) #enter zero (0) if you do not have the data
- coverage (%) #enter zero (0) if you do not have the data
